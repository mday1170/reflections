Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Share the project with other people.


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe some changes shouldn't get committed and added into the repository.  Users probably want full control of the changes that are committed/added.
